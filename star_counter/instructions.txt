# Star Counter

The data set you'll be working with for this activity contains 50 rows of "review data" used by French and Spanish online learning programs. Columns D through H represent the number of stars each respective program received as feedback. For example, the first row of the data shows that a French program received two out of five stars in Monnie Mccasland's review.

Data stored this way can be difficult to analyze, so you'll be using VBA to convert it to numerical data.

## Instructions

* Create a VBA script that tallies the number of "Full Stars" per row and enters them into the Total column.

* Create two charts: 

  * One to see if there is a relationship between Program Type and Rating (Bar Chart).

  * The other to see if there is a relationship between Date and Rating (Line Graph).
