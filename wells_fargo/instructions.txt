## Instructions

* Create code that formats a single sheet first and then, once this has been accomplished successfully, modifying the code to loop through and modify each worksheet within the workbook. Do the following:

  * Extract words before the phrase "\_Wells_Fargo" to figure out the state.

  * Add the state to the first column of each spreadsheet.

  * Convert the headers of each row to simply say the year.

  * Convert the numbers to currency values for all cells.

# Part II

In this second part of the project, you will be combining all of their previous sheets into one massive table on a new sheet.

* Loop through every worksheet and select the state contents.

* Copy the state contents and paste it into the Combined_Data tab.
